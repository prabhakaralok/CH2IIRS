# CH2IIRS
Chandrayaan 2 Level 2 IIRS data processing.
This plugin performs thermal correction in the radiance data of Imaging Infrared Spectrometer (IIRS) sensor of Chandrayaan 2. </br>Algorithm of the plugin can be found at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103522001853"> Verma, P. A., Chauhan, M., & Chauhan, P. (2022). Lunar surface temperature estimation and thermal emission correction using Chandrayaan-2 imaging infrared spectrometer data for H2O & OH detection using 3 Î¼m hydration feature. Icarus, 383, 115075 </a>.</br>
Radiance image of IIRS and solar flux are the input for this plugin. However, solar flux is optional input. All the inputs should be corresponding to all 256 bands of IIRS.

<b> One of the there radio buttons need to be selected: </b>
</br>
<ul>Thermal Correction: 
<ul><li> Performs only thermal correction </li>
  <li>Thermally corrected reflectance and temperature files will be created, named as <i>input_filename_corrRef</i> and <i>input_filename_Temp</i> respectively. </li>
  <li>Tool will work for any spatial subset of radiance image also.</li></ul></ul>
</br>
<ul>Indcidence angle: 
  <ul><li>Creates incidence angle image</li>
 <li> Angle file having name <i>input_filename_angle</i> will be created </li>
<li>Tool will work for entire scence only. </li>
<li>Note: Input file as well as other supporting files must be in the folder structure of ISSDC </li></ul></ul>
</br>
<ul>Thermal and Incidence angle correction: 
<ul> <li> Performs correction for temperature as well as incidence angle</li>
 <li> Tool will work for entire scence only.</li>
  <li>Thermally and incidence angle corrected reflectance, temperature, incidence angle will be the outputs and <i>input_filename_inc_corrRef</i>, <i>input_filename_Temp</i>, <i>input_filename_angle</i> files will be created respectively.</li>
  <li>Note: Input file as well as other supporting files must be in the folder structure of ISSDC</li></ul></ul>
